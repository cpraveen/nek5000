Compute eigenvalues of channel flow using time stepper approach with ARPACK

"doc" contains some notes and a chebyshev code for computing eigenvalues.
"nek" contains files for nek5000

To run:
1. Compile arnoldi driver using makefile
2. Compile nek5000 inside directory nek

Possible choice of parameters:

nev   = 4
ncv   = 20
nsteps= 50
dt    = 2e-2
